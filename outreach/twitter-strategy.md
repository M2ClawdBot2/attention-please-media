# Twitter/X Outreach Strategy — Attention Please Media

---

## Content Pillars

### 1. Before/After Redesigns (Best Performing Content)

Take ugly websites, redesign them (even as unsolicited concepts), and post side-by-side.

**Format:**
> "I redesigned [Business/Org]'s website in 24 hours. Here's the before and after 🧵👇"
>
> [Before screenshot] → [After screenshot or video]
>
> "No templates. No WordPress. Just clean code and bold design."
>
> "Want yours done? DM me. Starting at $250."

**Where to find ugly sites to redesign:**
- Local restaurants, barbershops, gyms
- Student org pages
- Political campaign sites
- Search "worst website design" for extreme examples (fun content, goes viral)

### 2. Design Tips & Hot Takes

Short, punchy tweets about web design:
- "Your website is your first impression. Most of you are showing up in sweatpants."
- "If your site looks like it was built in 2015, your customers assume your business is stuck there too."
- "Bold typography > stock photos. Every time."
- "Your website shouldn't need a tutorial."
- "Stop paying $10K for a WordPress theme with your logo on it."

### 3. Process Videos / Behind the Scenes

- Screen recordings of building a site (sped up)
- "Watch me design a landing page in 2 hours"
- Animation breakdowns showing how scroll effects work

### 4. Client Results / Testimonials

- Screenshot DMs (with permission) of happy clients
- "Just shipped this site for [client]. 48 hours from brief to live."

## Finding Targets — Search Queries

### People Asking for Help
- `"need a website" -filter:links`
- `"looking for web designer"`
- `"anyone know a web designer"`
- `"my website sucks"`
- `"website redesign" help`
- `"need a landing page"`
- `"web designer recommendations"`

### Businesses / Orgs with Bad Sites
- `"our website" "working on it"` (acknowledging their site needs work)
- `"new website coming soon"` (they need someone)
- Search local business hashtags + check their link in bio

### Political / Campaign Targets
- `"campaign website" launch`
- `"running for" website`
- `"volunteer" "campaign" site`

### Creator Targets
- `"link in bio" -linktree` (creators using basic link pages who need a real site)
- `"finally making a website"`
- `"portfolio website" help`

## DM vs Public Reply

### Public Reply (Preferred — Gets Visibility)

When someone tweets about needing a website or having an ugly one:

> "I could fix this in 48 hours. Check my work: [our site]. DM me if you're serious 🤝"

Keep it short, confident, not desperate. One reply — don't spam.

### DM Approach (For Specific Targets)

Use the DM templates from `dm-templates.md`. On Twitter specifically:
- **Like a few of their recent tweets first** (warm up)
- **Reply to something genuine** before DMing
- **Keep the DM under 3 sentences**
- **Don't DM someone who hasn't interacted with you** unless they posted about needing help

## Growth Tactics

1. **Post daily.** Even if it's just a design tip or hot take.
2. **Engage with other designers** — RT, quote tweet, comment. Build community.
3. **Use hashtags sparingly:** #webdesign #uidesign #buildinpublic
4. **Pin your best before/after** to your profile.
5. **Bio should be clear:** "I design websites that demand attention. Custom builds starting at $250. Portfolio 👇"
6. **Thread game:** Threads (🧵) get more reach than single tweets. Use them for before/afters and tutorials.
7. **Post between 9am–12pm and 6pm–9pm EST** for best engagement.
8. **Quote tweet viral "ugly website" posts** with your redesign take.
