# Upwork Profile — Attention Please Media

---

## Profile Title

**Premium Web Designer | Custom Sites with Bold Animations & Modern Design**

---

## Overview

I build websites that make people stop scrolling.

Every site I create is 100% custom — no templates, no page builders, no generic layouts. My signature style: bold typography, cinematic scroll animations, and interfaces that feel alive. I've worked with businesses, creators, political campaigns, and student organizations who needed a web presence that actually matches how good they are.

**What I bring:**
- Custom design & development (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Next.js)
- Smooth animations & micro-interactions
- Fully responsive, fast-loading sites
- Clean, maintainable code you own completely
- 48-hour average turnaround

Other agencies charge $5K–$20K for what I deliver starting at $250. I keep prices reasonable because I believe great design shouldn't bankrupt you.

## Hourly Rate

**$50/hr** (positions you as premium but accessible — undercuts agencies charging $100-200/hr while signaling quality above the $15-25/hr crowd)

---

## Fixed-Price Positioning

For most projects, push fixed-price. It's better for both sides:

| Project Type | Price | Pitch |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page | $250–$400 | "One powerful page, 48hr turnaround" |
| Multi-page site (3-5 pages) | $500–$750 | "Full site with animations & nav" |
| Premium build (5-10 pages) | $800–$1,000 | "The full experience — complex animations, interactive elements" |
| Redesign / refresh | $300–$600 | "Modern redesign of your existing site" |

**In proposals, always quote fixed-price.** Hourly is there for ongoing maintenance or clients who insist.

## Tips for Upwork Success

1. **Apply to jobs within 1 hour of posting** — early proposals get seen
2. **Keep proposals short** (3-4 sentences max + portfolio link)
3. **Reference their specific project** — never send generic proposals
4. **Start with 2-3 lower-priced jobs** to build reviews, then raise rates
5. **Use "Boosted" proposals** on high-value jobs ($500+)
6. **Respond to messages within 1 hour** — response time affects ranking
