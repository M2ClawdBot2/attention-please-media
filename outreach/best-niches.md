## 🏆 Tier 1: Easiest to Convert (High Money, High Urgency, Easy to Find)

### 1. Home Service Contractors (Plumbers, HVAC, Electricians, Roofers)
- **Why they're gold:** They have money (avg revenue $500K–$2M), terrible websites or none at all, and TONS of local competition. Every lead they miss to a competitor with a better Google presence costs them $500–$5,000+ in jobs. They're too busy working to build a site themselves.
- **Reddit consensus:** "Niched down into trades and home services. They have money and bad websites with lots of competition." One dev charges $3,500 for 5-page sites in this niche — $500–$1,000 is a bargain to them.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps (search "[trade] near me" — look for businesses with no website or terrible ones), Yelp, Angi/HomeAdvisor listings, Thumbtack, local Facebook groups, literally drive around and note van lettering with no website listed.
- **Willingness to pay:** HIGH. $500–$1,000 is pocket change vs. their job ticket sizes. Many already pay $200–$500/mo for lead gen services.
- **Target pool:** Millions in the US. Every city has hundreds of these businesses.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Owner-operated, no gatekeepers, phone number right on Google. They understand ROI intuitively ("one job pays for the website").

### 2. Real Estate Agents / Small Brokerages
- **Why they're gold:** Extremely competitive industry where personal branding is everything. Most agents have a garbage page on their brokerage's site or nothing at all. They're commission-based and understand that marketing = money.
- **How to find them:** Realtor.com, Zillow agent directory, local MLS sites, Google Maps, Instagram (many market there with no website), Facebook groups for realtors.
- **Willingness to pay:** HIGH. A single commission is $5K–$15K+. $500 for a site is nothing.
- **Target pool:** ~1.5 million active real estate agents in the US alone.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Easy to contact directly, hungry for leads, understand marketing spend.

### 3. Dentists / Dental Practices
- **Why they're gold:** High-revenue practices ($600K–$2M+/yr), many with outdated websites from 2012. Extremely local and competitive. Patients Google "dentist near me" — if the site looks bad, they bounce.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps, Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Yelp, state dental association directories.
- **Willingness to pay:** HIGH. They spend $2K–$5K/mo on marketing already. $500–$1,000 for a site is trivial.
- **Target pool:** ~200,000 dental practices in the US.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Usually have an office manager who handles this, but the dentist-owner makes the call. Slightly more process than a solo contractor.

## 🥈 Tier 2: Strong Targets (Good Money, Moderate Effort to Close)

### 4. Chiropractors / Physical Therapists / Med Spas
- **Why:** Same dynamics as dentists but even MORE reliant on online presence for new patient acquisition. Med spas especially are booming and image-conscious. Many chiropractors are solo operators with direct decision-making.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps, Healthgrades, Yelp, state licensing boards, Instagram (med spas especially).
- **Willingness to pay:** HIGH. These are $300K–$1M+/yr businesses.
- **Target pool:** ~70,000 chiropractors, ~40,000 med spas in US (growing fast).
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 5. Lawyers / Small Law Firms (Personal Injury, Family Law, Immigration, DUI)
- **Why:** Hyper-competitive for local searches. A single client can be worth $5K–$50K+ to a lawyer. They NEED to rank locally and look credible. Many solo/small firms have embarrassing sites.
- **How to find them:** Avvo, FindLaw, Google Maps, state bar association directories, Martindale-Hubbell.
- **Willingness to pay:** VERY HIGH. They understand cost-per-acquisition. But some will lowball because lawyers gonna lawyer.
- **Target pool:** ~450,000 small law firms in the US.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Can be demanding clients, but they pay. Stick to solo/small firms to avoid bureaucracy.

### 6. Restaurants / Cafes / Food Trucks
- **Why:** Most restaurant websites are ATROCIOUS. Can't find the menu, hours are wrong, not mobile-friendly. They need online ordering, reservations, menu display. Post-COVID, online presence is non-negotiable.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps (literally every city block), Yelp, DoorDash/UberEats listings (restaurants paying 30% commission who'd benefit from direct ordering).
- **Willingness to pay:** MODERATE. Margins are thin. $250–$500 is the sweet spot. Don't expect $1,000 from a taco truck.
- **Target pool:** ~1 million restaurants in the US.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Easy to walk in and talk to the owner. BUT: tight budgets and high failure rate. Keep it simple and cheap.

### 7. Auto Repair Shops / Auto Detailing / Car Dealerships (Small/Independent)
- **Why:** Most independent shops have either no website or a catastrophic one from 2008. Customers search "oil change near me" or "auto repair [city]" constantly. They're losing to chains with better online presence.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps, Yelp, RepairPal, local business directories.
- **Willingness to pay:** MODERATE-HIGH. $500–$1,000 is very reasonable for a shop doing $300K+/yr.
- **Target pool:** ~280,000 auto repair shops in the US.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## 🥉 Tier 3: Good But Requires More Selling

### 8. Landscaping / Lawn Care / Tree Services
- **Why:** Seasonal urgency, very local, lots of competition. Many are 1-3 person operations with zero web presence — just a Facebook page. When spring hits, homeowners Google for services.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps, Nextdoor, Craigslist, local Facebook groups, literally look for yard signs.
- **Willingness to pay:** MODERATE. $250–$750. They're not always as flush as plumbers/electricians.
- **Target pool:** Huge — hundreds of thousands of operators.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐ — Many don't see the value of a website ("I get all my business from word of mouth"). Requires educating them.

### 9. Gyms / Personal Trainers / Yoga Studios / Fitness
- **Why:** Membership-based businesses that need to capture leads online. Many boutique studios have terrible sites. Personal trainers often have nothing but an Instagram page.
- **How to find them:** Google Maps, Instagram, ClassPass, MindBody.
- **Willingness to pay:** LOW-MODERATE. $250–$500 for trainers, $500–$1,000 for established studios.
- **Target pool:** Large but fragmented.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐ — Trainers are often broke. Studios are better targets.

### 10. Wedding Vendors (Photographers, Planners, Florists, Venues)
- **Why:** Wedding industry is huge ($70B+/yr). These businesses NEED a beautiful portfolio site. Many photographers especially have outdated WordPress sites.
- **How to find them:** The Knot, WeddingWire, Instagram, Google Maps.
- **Willingness to pay:** MODERATE. $500–$1,000 for photographers/planners. They understand visual presentation matters.
- **Target pool:** Large — every city has dozens to hundreds.
- **Conversion ease:** ⭐⭐⭐ — Seasonal demand, some are side-hustlers with small budgets.

## ⛔ Niches to AVOID

| Niche | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Nonprofits** | No money. Expect you to work for free or nearly free. Decision-by-committee. |
| **Child care centers** | Universally cited as nightmare clients on Reddit. Low budgets, endless revisions. |
| **Churches / Religious orgs** | Committee decisions, no budget, guilt-trip you into discounts. |
| **Startups with no revenue** | "We'll pay you in equity." No. |
| **Artists / Musicians** | Broke. Will want unlimited revisions for $200. |
| **Fellow freelancers** | Know too much, will backseat-drive, expect friend pricing. |

## 🎯 Recommended Starting Strategy

**Pick ONE niche from Tier 1. Start with Home Service Contractors or Real Estate Agents.**

Why:
1. **Templatable** — Every plumber/realtor needs the same 5 pages (Home, Services, About, Reviews, Contact). Build one great template, customize per client.
2. **Easy ROI pitch** — "One new job/client from your website pays for the entire site."
3. **No gatekeepers** — Call the owner directly. Their number is on Google.
4. **Findable at scale** — Google Maps search → filter by no website or bad website → cold email/call.
5. **Recurring revenue potential** — Hosting + maintenance at $50–$100/mo = long-term income.

### Prospecting Workflow
1. Search Google Maps for "[trade] in [city]"
2. Click through to each business
3. If no website, ugly website, or non-mobile site → add to outreach list
4. Find owner name + email (website, Facebook, LinkedIn)
5. Send personalized cold email or call directly
6. Show a mockup of what their site COULD look like
