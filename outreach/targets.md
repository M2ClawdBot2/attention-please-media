## 🎓 Student Organizations (Non-Local Universities)

Most student orgs have zero web presence beyond their campus portal page or a dead Instagram. Huge opportunity.

### How to Find Them
- Google "[University] student organizations list" → browse their portal
- Search "[org name] [university]" and check if they have a real website
- DM their president/VP on Instagram

### Political / Advocacy Orgs to Target
- **College Republicans** at schools listed below
- **Turning Point USA chapters** — large, active, high visibility. Most have no custom site.
- **Young Americans for Freedom chapters** — conservative orgs, rarely have websites
- **Students for Life chapters** — pro-life orgs on campuses nationwide
- **Network of Enlightened Women (NeW)** — conservative women's org with many chapters

### Business / Professional Orgs
- **Entrepreneurship clubs** — they should have sick websites and usually don't
- **Advertising/marketing societies** — ironic if their site is bad. Great pitch angle.
- **Consulting clubs** (180 Degrees, etc.) — need professional presence

### Greek Life
- **Fraternity/sorority chapter websites** — most look terrible. Search "[chapter name] [university]" and check their sites. There are thousands of these.

### Creative / Media
- **Film societies, student media orgs, campus radio** — creative people who appreciate good design

## 🏛️ College Republican Chapters (Other Universities)

Most chapter websites are either nonexistent or look like they were built in 2008. Low-hanging fruit.

| School | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Georgia College Republicans** | Check site | Large SEC school |
| **Alabama College Republicans** | Check site | Large, active chapter |
| **Texas College Republicans** | Check site | Massive state org |
| **Ohio State CRs** | Check site | Big Ten, big chapter |
| **Michigan College Republicans** | Check site | Often in the news |
| **Penn State CRs** | Check site | Large membership |
| **Arizona College Republicans** | Check site | Swing state = high visibility |
| **Florida State CRs** | Check site | Large chapter |
| **UCF College Republicans** | Check site | Huge enrollment |
| **USF College Republicans** | Check site | Tampa market |
| **LSU College Republicans** | Check site | SEC school |
| **Clemson College Republicans** | Check site | Active chapter |

**Action:** Google each one. If their site is ugly or nonexistent, DM their president/VP on Instagram or Twitter.

## 🇺🇸 Conservative / Political Organizations (Small-Mid Size)

These orgs often have outdated sites and actual budgets to fix them.

- **County-level Republican Party committees** — Most county GOP sites look terrible. Pick 10-20 in swing states (FL, GA, AZ, PA, MI, WI) and pitch redesigns.
- **Young Republicans National Federation** — State/local chapters
- **Students for Life** — Campus chapters with weak web presence
- **Campus Reform** contributors — Student journalists who might need portfolio sites
- **Heritage Action local groups** — Grassroots conservative groups
- **Local Republican Women's clubs** — Often have the worst websites imaginable. Easy pitch.
- **State-level Federalist Society chapters** — Law school orgs, professional audience
