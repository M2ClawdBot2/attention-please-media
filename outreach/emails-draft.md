## 1. Virginia Tech College Republicans
**To:** Find contact email on their Wix site or social media
**Subject:** Your website could be way better — free mockup

Hey,

I came across your site and wanted to reach out. I run Attention Please Media — we build premium websites for political orgs and student groups.

We recently built a site for a major college Republican chapter and the response was insane. Check it out: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

Compare that to what you've got on Wix right now — you guys deserve way better. A real site with a custom domain, clean design, and actual branding would go a long way for recruitment and credibility.

We could build something like that for you starting at $250. Happy to do a free mockup so you can see what it'd look like before committing to anything.

Let me know if you're interested.

## 2. WVU College Republicans
**To:** Find contact email
**Subject:** Quick question about your website

Hey,

Not gonna sugarcoat it — your current Wix site isn't doing you any favors. A strong web presence matters for recruitment and getting taken seriously on campus.

We just built a site for another college Republican chapter and it turned out great: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

We're Attention Please Media — we build modern, clean websites specifically for orgs like yours. Starting at $250, custom domain, the whole deal. No templates, no Wix/Weebly.

Would love to help you guys level up. Want to see a free mockup of what your site could look like?

## 3. Minnesota State College Republicans
**To:** Find contact email
**Subject:** Saw your site — we can help

Hey,

Found your Weebly site and figured I'd reach out. We're Attention Please Media — we build premium websites for political organizations and student groups at prices that actually make sense.

Here's what we built for another college Republican chapter recently: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

Night and day difference from a stock Weebly template. We're talking custom design, animations, mobile-ready, your own domain — starting at $250.

If you're interested, we'll do a free mockup so you can see the vision before you spend a dime. No pressure either way.

## 4. Robert Morris University College Republicans
**To:** Find contact email
**Subject:** Your chapter deserves a real website

Hey,

I came across your Weebly site and honestly — your chapter deserves better than a bulleted list on a free template. First impressions matter, especially when you're trying to recruit.

We're Attention Please Media. We recently designed a site for a college Republican chapter that completely changed their online presence: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

We build custom sites starting at $250 — real design, real branding, none of that Wix/Weebly stuff. Happy to put together a free mockup for you guys.

Let me know if you're interested.

## 5. UC Santa Cruz College Republicans
**To:** Find contact email
**Subject:** Website upgrade for your chapter

Hey,

Your Weebly site looks like it hasn't been touched in a while — totally get it, web design isn't what you guys signed up to do. That's where we come in.

We're Attention Please Media. We build modern, professional websites for political orgs. Here's one we recently did for a college Republican chapter: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

Clean, bold, mobile-ready, with actual branding — starting at $250. We'll even do a free mockup so you can see what yours could look like.

Interested?

## 6. College Republican Federation of Virginia
**To:** Find contact email
**Subject:** A state-level org deserves a state-level website

Hey,

You're a state-level federation of College Republicans — that's a big deal. Your web presence should match. Right now you're on a free Weebly with a 50-character subdomain URL, and that's not doing your brand justice.

We're Attention Please Media. We specialize in websites for political organizations. Here's what we built for a major college Republican chapter recently: https://m2clawdbot2.github.io/ufcr-website/

For an organization at your level, we'd recommend our mid-tier package — custom multi-page site with your own domain, clean design, and real branding. Starting at $500.

Happy to put together a free mockup to show you the vision. No commitment.
