## Gig Description

**Your website should make people stop scrolling. I'll make sure it does.**

I'm a web designer who builds premium, custom websites with a signature style — bold typography, cinematic animations, and interfaces that feel alive. No templates. No cookie-cutter layouts. Every site is designed and built from scratch for your brand.

**What you get:**
- 100% custom design (zero templates, ever)
- Smooth scroll animations & micro-interactions
- Fully responsive (looks perfect on every device)
- Fast load times & clean code
- Unlimited revisions until you love it

**Who this is for:**
- Businesses that want to stand out, not blend in
- Creators & influencers who need a site that matches their energy
- Campaigns & organizations that need to make a first impression
- Anyone tired of boring, generic websites

Other agencies charge $5,000–$20,000 for what I deliver at a fraction of the cost. Check my portfolio to see the difference.

**Average turnaround: 48 hours.**

Let's build something that demands attention.

## FAQ
