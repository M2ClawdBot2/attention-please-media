## 🐘 College Republican / Political Org Chapters (Wix/Weebly)

These are goldmines — free Wix/Weebly sites with zero design effort, run by student orgs that turn over leadership yearly and never prioritize web presence.

### 1. College Republicans at UC Irvine
- **URL:** https://crucirvine.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Default Weebly template, barely any content — just a paragraph and a PayPal donate button. Claims to be "largest conservative club on campus" but the site screams ghost town.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good — active org, would benefit from a real site

### 2. Boston College Republicans
- **URL:** https://bostoncollegegop.wixsite.com/home
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix subdomain (wixsite.com/home 💀), generic template, minimal content, no events or photos. Just a mission statement floating in space.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good — Boston College has money, could convert to paid client

### 3. Virginia Tech College Republicans
- **URL:** https://vtcollegerepublicans.wixsite.com/vtcrs
- **What's wrong:** Another wixsite.com subdomain embarrassment. Generic layout, no branding beyond the name. URL alone screams "we don't care about our web presence."
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good — large state school, active chapter

### 4. West Virginia University College Republicans
- **URL:** https://wvcollegerepublica.wixsite.com/wvurepublicans
- **What's wrong:** The URL is literally truncated ("wvcollegerepublica" — they ran out of characters). Free Wix. Zero design effort.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great for roast content — that URL alone is meme-worthy

### 5. MNSU College Republicans (Minnesota State)
- **URL:** https://mnsucollegerepublicans.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Stock Weebly template, sparse content, "shoot us an email to join" as the CTA. No photos, no events, no personality.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — smaller school but could use the help

### 6. RMU College Republicans (Robert Morris University)
- **URL:** https://rmucollegerepublicans.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Bare-bones Weebly. Literally just a bulleted list of their purpose statement. No images, no events, no members, nothing. A placeholder pretending to be a website.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good for before/after content (dramatic transformation potential)

### 7. College Republicans at UC Santa Cruz
- **URL:** https://ucscgop.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Default Weebly, wall of text mission statement, no visual design whatsoever. Looks made in 2015 and never touched again.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent

### 8. College Republican Federation of Virginia
- **URL:** https://collegerepublicanfederationofvirginia.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** That URL is 50+ characters of Weebly subdomain. A STATE-LEVEL organization with a free Weebly site. The irony writes itself.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great — state-level org, should absolutely have a real site

### 9. NMU College Republicans (Northern Michigan University)
- **URL:** https://nmucollegerepublicans.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Another long Weebly subdomain, stock template, minimal content. Cookie-cutter political org site.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent

### 10. Ursinus College Republicans
- **URL:** https://ucrepublicans.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Bare Weebly with virtually nothing on it. If this is the face of conservatism at Ursinus, the left is winning the branding war.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — small liberal arts school

### 11. Tennessee Teenage Republicans
- **URL:** https://nashvilletars.wixsite.com/teenagerepublicans
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix, "nashvilletars" as the subdomain (sounds like something else entirely). State political youth org stuck on a free site builder.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good — youth orgs love looking professional

### 12. EUHS Young Republicans Club
- **URL:** https://euhsyoungrepublicans.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** The page title literally says "EUHS Young Republicans Clu]]]]b" — they have stray brackets in their own site name. Beyond parody.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ AMAZING roast content — they broke their own title tag

## 🏪 Small Businesses (Non-Gainesville, Disconnected Markets)

### 13. El Azteca Mexican Restaurant — Chicago, IL
- **URL:** https://elaztecafullertonc.wixsite.com/mysite
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix with the dreaded "/mysite" default slug. Family-owned restaurant in Belmont Cragin deserves better than "elaztecafullertonc.wixsite.com."
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — restaurants are tough clients but great content

### 14. CariSoul Cuisine — Atlanta, GA
- **URL:** https://jsurpris14261.wixsite.com/carisoulcuisine
- **What's wrong:** URL starts with "jsurpris14261" — a random personal Wix account. Caribbean restaurant in the heart of Atlanta but their web presence says "side project." Free Wix.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great — Atlanta market, real business, the URL alone is roast material

### 15. Pipe Systems Plumbing — Portland, OR
- **URL:** https://pipesystems.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Free Weebly for a full-service plumbing contractor. Stock template, no custom domain. "We service the entire metro area" but can't service their own website.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — service businesses convert well

### 16. Keane Landscaping — Dallas, TX
- **URL:** https://keanelandscapingdallas.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Free Weebly, claims to be "industry leader in Dallas landscape design." Industry leaders don't use free Weebly. No custom domain, default template.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great — Dallas market, service biz with aspirations that outpace their site

### 17. The Next Level Salon
- **URL:** https://thenextlevelsalon.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** A salon called "The Next Level" stuck on a very much current-level Weebly free site. Been open since 2008 — 18 years and still no real website.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great roast — the name vs. reality contrast is perfect content

### 18. Studio LA Salon
- **URL:** https://studiolasalon.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Free Weebly for a salon that claims to be "one of the finest salons you'll ever step foot in." The website tells a very different story.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Good — beauty businesses care about aesthetics (or should)

### 19. ONE ONE FIVE Salon (Hair by Sami)
- **URL:** https://hairbysami2020.wixsite.com/hairbysami
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix, "hairbysami2020" as subdomain (with a year that's now 6 years old). Business has a brand name (ONE ONE FIVE) but the URL says otherwise entirely.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — solo stylist, may not have budget

### 20. L&D Plumbing & Heating — NJ Shore
- **URL:** https://ldplumbingandheating.wixsite.com/plumber
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix with "/plumber" as the slug. Serves Ocean, Atlantic & Monmouth counties. Reviews mention "Robbie came and fixed my toilet!" but the site looks like Robbie built it too.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐⭐ Great — multi-county service area, has money to spend

### 21. Plummers Plumbing — Roseburg, OR
- **URL:** https://plummersplumbing.weebly.com/
- **What's wrong:** Free Weebly. The entire site is basically their address and phone number. A business card would convey more information. Also: "Plummers" — a plumber whose name is a misspelling of their profession.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Small market but funny content

### 22. Wecare Salon Cafe
- **URL:** https://wecarecs.wixsite.com/wecaresaloncafe
- **What's wrong:** Free Wix, mother-daughter owned business since 2018. Unique concept (salon + cafe combo) with a generic template. The abbreviated "wecarecs" subdomain looks like a typo.
- **Outreach target:** ⭐ Decent — cool concept deserves a cool site

## 📊 Summary & Content Strategy

**Best for viral before/after roasts (Twitter content):**
1. **EUHS Young Republicans** — they have "Clu]]]]b" in their own page title. Broken beyond belief.
2. **WVU College Republicans** — truncated URL is comedy gold
3. **CariSoul Cuisine** — "jsurpris14261" as your restaurant's URL subdomain
4. **Keane Landscaping** — "industry leader" on free Weebly
5. **The Next Level Salon** — name promises what the site can't deliver
6. **College Republican Federation of Virginia** — state org on free Weebly

**Best outreach targets (likely to convert to paying clients):**
1. L&D Plumbing (multi-county NJ, established)
2. Keane Landscaping Dallas (aspirational brand, real market)
3. The Next Level Salon (18 years in business)
4. CariSoul Cuisine Atlanta (growing market)
5. College Republican Federation of Virginia (state-level org)

**Common issues across all sites:**
- Free Wix/Weebly subdomains (no custom domain)
- Default templates with zero customization
- Minimal or no content beyond a mission statement
- No imagery, no branding, no personality
- Embarrassing URLs full of random account names and truncated words
- Abandoned/outdated information
