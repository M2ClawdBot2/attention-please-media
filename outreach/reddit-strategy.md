# Reddit Outreach Strategy — Attention Please Media

---

## Core Principle

**Add value first. Sell never (directly).** Reddit hates self-promotion. The play is to be genuinely helpful, build karma and reputation, and let people come to you.

---

## Target Subreddits

### Tier 1 — Direct Opportunities (people actively need websites)
- **r/forhire** — Post [For Hire] threads. This is the ONE place self-promotion is welcome.
- **r/slavelabour** — Budget-friendly gigs. Good for $250 landing pages.
- **r/freelance** — Discussions about freelancing. Help people, mention your work when relevant.
- **r/smallbusiness** — Business owners constantly ask about websites.
- **r/Entrepreneur** — Same energy. Lots of "do I need a website?" posts.
- **r/startups** — Early-stage founders need landing pages.

### Tier 2 — Design Community (build reputation)
- **r/web_design** — Share knowledge, critique others' work, post your own for feedback.
- **r/webdev** — Technical discussions. Show you know your stuff.
- **r/UI_Design** — Share design insights.
- **r/Frontend** — Technical credibility.

### Tier 3 — Niche Audiences (find clients in their habitat)
- **r/politics**, **r/conservative**, **r/Republican** — Don't sell here. Just be present and aware of orgs.
- **r/twitch**, **r/YouTubers**, **r/NewTubers** — Creators who need sites.
- **r/bands**, **r/WeAreTheMusicMakers** — Musicians always need sites.
- **University subreddits** (r/OSU, r/UTAustin, r/Bama, etc.) — Engage naturally, mention you do student org sites when relevant.

## Content Playbook

### r/forhire — Post Every 1-2 Weeks

**Example post:**

> **[For Hire] Web Designer — Custom sites with bold animations, no templates. Starting at $250.**
>
> Hey! I run a small design studio that builds premium custom websites. No WordPress themes, no Squarespace — everything is hand-coded with smooth animations and modern design.
>
> **What I do:**
> - Landing pages ($250)
> - Multi-page sites ($500)
> - Premium builds with complex animations ($1000)
>
> 48hr average turnaround. Unlimited revisions.
>
> Portfolio: [our site]
>
> DM me or drop a comment if you're interested. Happy to chat about your project.

### r/smallbusiness & r/Entrepreneur — Comment on "Website" Posts

When someone asks "Do I need a website?" or "How much should a website cost?":

> Definitely get a site — social media is rented land. For a small business, you don't need to spend $5K. A solid custom landing page runs $250-500 if you find the right designer. Look for someone who builds custom (not WordPress templates) and can show you a portfolio you actually like. The vibe of the site matters more than the feature list.

*Don't link your site unless someone asks. Let the advice speak.*

### r/web_design — Share Knowledge Posts

**Example post ideas:**
- "3 scroll animation techniques that make sites feel premium"
- "Why I stopped using templates and went 100% custom"
- "Landing page design breakdown: what makes visitors stay"

*Include screenshots/examples from your own work naturally.*

### University Subreddits — Be a Community Member

Pick 3-5 large university subs (r/OSU, r/UTAustin, r/Bama, r/TexasTech, etc.) and engage naturally. When website/design comes up: "I actually do web design for student orgs — happy to help if anyone needs a site built."

## Rules to NOT Get Banned

1. **Follow the 90/10 rule** — 90% of your activity should be genuine comments/discussions. 10% or less can reference your work.
2. **Never drop links unprompted** in non-promotional subs.
3. **Read each sub's rules** before posting. Some ban all self-promo.
4. **Don't use multiple accounts** to upvote yourself.
5. **Don't copy-paste the same comment** across subs.
6. **Build karma first** — spend 2 weeks just being helpful before any promotional posts.
7. **If someone asks for your portfolio, share via DM** unless the sub allows links.
8. **Flair your posts correctly** on r/forhire.
9. **Don't argue with trolls.** Ever. Move on.
10. **Delete and repost** r/forhire posts that don't gain traction (max once per week per their rules).
